  	JAKARTA
  	<br><br>
  	We recently got married, I settled down to a foreign land to finally be with my husband, no more LDR for us. 
    Until now, I still cannot believe that I am already married and have been living in the US for 2 months.
    Time has gone really fast, I guess I have adjusted quite fast.
    Being away from my family and own country is like going out of my comfort zone.
    Now, I  just have to completely trust my life to my lovely caring husband.
    It's my first time living together with someone other than my family.
    There has been quite a lot of adjustments for both of us, in terms of personality, culture, etc.
    From the first day of marriage until now, I think I have cried a lot of times, we would argue and make up and so on, but I guess that's normal.
    <br><br>
    After all, we are still newly weds and we still have a lot of time to really get to know each other in a much deeper way.
    I still don't know what my future holds here, but I know I will be alright.
    I know I can do it, with the help and support of my husband, someone I can trust and I can lean on no matter what, 
    and I believe that is one of the perks of marriage. You know you have someone with you in all your endeavors. 
    Life in the US has been pretty easy for me so far, thanks again to my hardworking husband who has been taking care of me since day 1.
    He has been moving mountains for me with the best of his ability just to make sure I feel comfortable here.
    On the other hand, I can also see that he is much happier now that I am here. I take care of him as much as he takes care of me.
    We only have each other, since both of our families are in different countries.
